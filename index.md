# Manuel Silva Vega🧠🛰️

_PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering (PUCV, Chile) · Visiting doctoral researcher at Université Clermont Auvergne (France)._

I work on **GeoAI and Earth Observation** to monitor the **stability of mine waste storage facilities (TSF, WRD, LWD)** in Chile.  
My research combines satellite imagery (Sentinel-1/2), DEMs and geotechnical data with modern deep learning (PyTorch, TorchGeo, vision transformers).

## Research snapshot

- 🛰️ **Satellite-based monitoring of mine waste facilities**  
  Multimodal models for mapping and tracking TSF, WRD and LWD across Chile.

- 🧪 **Risk indicators from remote sensing**  
  Simple, explainable indicators derived from imagery and DEMs to support geotechnical assessment.

- 📦 **Open datasets & code**  
  Building **MineWasteCL_DB** and related pipelines to support reproducible research in GeoAI for mining.
