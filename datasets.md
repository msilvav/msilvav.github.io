# Datasets & Code 📦

## MineWasteCL_DB (in progress)

A large-scale dataset of **mine waste storage facilities in Chile** built from multisource satellite imagery:

- ✅ >30,000 image tiles (Sentinel-2 and other sources)
- ✅ COCO-style annotations for TSF, WRD, LWD and related classes
- ✅ Compatible with PyTorch / TorchGeo workflows

If you’re interested in early access for research collaboration, feel free to contact me.

## Open-source pipelines

I’m progressively releasing code for:

- Tile generation from Sentinel-1/2 and DEMs
- Training segmentation / detection models (PyTorch, TorchGeo, Ultralytics)
- Simple risk indicators derived from imagery
