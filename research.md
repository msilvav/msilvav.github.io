# Research 👨‍🔬

I am a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at **PUCV (Chile)** and visiting doctoral researcher at **Université Clermont Auvergne (France)**.  
My work lies at the intersection of **GeoAI, computer vision and geotechnical engineering**.

## Thesis topic

**“Towards a multimodal AI framework for monitoring and predicting the stability of mine waste storage facilities in Chile.”**

Key ingredients:

- Multispectral optical data (Sentinel-2) and SAR (Sentinel-1)
- DEMs and other elevation products
- Simple geotechnical and contextual information (climate, topography, facility geometry)
- Deep learning for detection, segmentation and change analysis

## Ongoing directions

- Mapping TSF/WRD/LWD footprints at national scale (Chile).
- Deriving physically meaningful indicators from imagery and DEMs.
- Studying how remote-sensing features relate to stability and risk.

If you’re interested in collaboration (datasets, methods or case studies), feel free to reach out.
