# Teaching 📚

I enjoy teaching and mentoring students in **programming, data science and GeoAI**.

## University teaching

- **EIE100 – Programming** (PUCV, Chile)  
  Introduction to programming for engineering students (Python / MATLAB), with emphasis on problem-solving and good coding practices.

- **Short workshops on GeoAI & Remote Sensing**  
  Internal seminars within the AI-MineSafe group on Python, PyTorch, TorchGeo and basic satellite image processing.

## Outreach

- **Explora Chile – school projects**  
  Support for science outreach projects (e.g., simple physics experiments, sensors and data acquisition) aimed at high-school students.

I’m always happy to share material or ideas for courses related to GeoAI, Earth Observation or scientific programming.
